# JavaScript Commenting System
Sample commenting system with topic index. I created this simple javascript project as part of an interview for a certain company.

## Question Statement:
**The goal is to create a public page to get user's feedback. When user enter this page, he/she can see other's posts and a form to post his/her comment on a topic.**
1. Allow users to enter their email address.
1. Allow users to enter a topic and text as a feedback.
1. Allow users to submit the message.
1. When the message is submitted, display it on the same page above the form including date and user information without refreshing the page.
1. Create a summary section to display a list of topics posted by all users at the bottom of the page and display total number of posts in each topic.

### Notes:
* Attempt to write clean code.
* Document any borrowed code.
* Choose any language or technology you are comfortable with.
* No need to persist data into database.
* Document any assumption.
* Document instruction to execute the site.
